I made my priority a scale out of 10, with 10 being the highest,

(MI1) - Update stock
As a staff member, I want to update my stock levels in the system after I refill my stock so that I can keep track of my stock levels.

    Acceptance Criteria: When a staff member updates the stock levels in the system and the system stores and correctly displays the updated amount of each stock.
     Priority - 9

(MI2) - Decrememt stock
As a staff member, I want the system to automatically decrement stock levels of the required ingredients of an order when the order is placed so that I will know when I am running low on certain ingredients.

    Priority - 8

(MI3) - Prevent unavailable orders
As a staff member, I want the system to prevent customers from placing orders that require ingredients that are unavailable so that they can order something that is available.

    Acceptance Criteria: When a customer attempts to select an item that has ingredients that are unavailable, the system will prevent the customer from selecting the item to add to the order.

As a staff member, I want to certain items to be stocked by volume or weight so that I can serve them in varying sizes.
